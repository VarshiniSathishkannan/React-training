In React:

Props are named inputs you pass to a component.

Children is a special prop that automatically includes any JSX nested inside a componentâ€™s opening and closing tags.

What Are Props?
Props are like arguments to functions. You pass them into components using attributes.

function Card({ title, subtitle }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{subtitle}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage
<Card title="Hello" subtitle="Welcome to React!" />

What is children?
children is a special prop that React gives you automatically. It contains whatever JSX is nested inside the component.

function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage
<Card>
  <h2>Hello</h2>
  <p>This is nested inside the card</p>
</Card>

âœ… Everything between <Card>...</Card> becomes the children prop.

How you pass it	As attributes (prop=value)	As nested content inside tags
Accessed via	props.name	props.children
Customizable names?	âœ… Yes	ðŸš« No (always called children)
Used for	Static data, functions, options	Nesting layout/content

2. Function as Children (a.k.a. render props)
This is more advanced and powerful. You pass a function as children, and the component calls that function with data.

Example:

<MyComponent>
  {(data) => <p>Data is: {data}</p>}
</MyComponent>
Inside MyComponent:


function MyComponent({ children }) {
  const someData = "React is fun!";
  return <div>{children(someData)}</div>;
}
