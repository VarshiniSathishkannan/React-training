Event handler
React events are named as camel case â€“ onClick
In plain html and vanilla JS we specify -- onclick
In JSX we have to specify the function names inside curly braces, (interpolation)
onClick = {clickHandler}
if we give paranthesis, then it becomes a function call and it gets called everytime render is called which is not something we want
So, we always have to give the function name without paranthesis for event handlers. We have to just replace the function in the onClick = {() => {}} so only variable has to be passed. The function is treated as a variable
Incase of Class component we use, this.clickHandler
Inside the class, methods are defined which are used as event handlers.
