What is Session Storage?
sessionStorage is part of the Web Storage API, and it's used to store key-value pairs in the browser — per tab, and per session.

Think of it as a short-term notepad that remembers data only while the browser tab is open.

🧩 Key Features

Feature	Description
📌 Storage Scope	Only for the current tab (not shared across tabs or windows)
🕒 Lifetime	Data is deleted when the tab or window is closed
🧠 Data Type	Stores everything as strings
📦 Capacity	Around 5MB (varies per browser)
🔐 Domain-based	Only accessible by scripts from the same origin
🔧 Basic Usage
✅ Set an item

sessionStorage.setItem("username", "john_doe");
✅ Get an item

const user = sessionStorage.getItem("username");
console.log(user); // "john_doe"
✅ Remove an item

sessionStorage.removeItem("username");
✅ Clear all session storage

sessionStorage.clear();
🧪 Real Example
Let’s say you want to store a user’s name temporarily while they fill out a multi-step form:


sessionStorage.setItem("step1Name", "Alice");
Then on the next page/step:


const name = sessionStorage.getItem("step1Name");
Once they close the tab — it's gone. Perfect for data you don’t need to persist long-term.

❓ How is it different from Local Storage?
