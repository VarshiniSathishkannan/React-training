Props 
-- short for property
-- data coming from the parent
-- Immutable data of the component â€“ they are read only, if we try to change the value, it throws an error

Parent child communication
-- props will be passed as an object from parent to child
-- we can also pass some text between the opening and closing tags which will be available in children props
<ContactUs> this is children </ContactUs>

import React from 'react'

const ContactUs = (props) => {
return (
    <div> 
        <h1> {props.children} </h1> 
        <h2> Called through arrow function </h2>
    </div>
);
}

export default ContactUs;

Child parent communication
We can pass data to parent through methods,
A method is passed as a props from parent to child. That method can be invoked in the child and we can also pass parameters to it.
The method defn will be in the parent but invoked from child
Parent :
  Converse(name)
  {
    alert(`Nothing much ${name}`);
  }


Child :
<button onClick={() => {this.props.converse('Varshini')}}> What's new </button>
