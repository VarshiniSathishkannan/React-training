JSX
JSX – JavaScript XML – Extension to the Javascript language syntax

Write XML like code for elements and components 
It is not a necessity to write in JSX for react applications
But it makes our code simpler and elegant
JSX tags will have attributes, tagname and children just like HTML hence it will be easier to adopt to it then plan JS
Ultimately JSX will be transpiled (Translation and compilation ) (Done by Babel) to JS which will be understood by the browser
That is why we import React from ‘react’ even though we don’t explicitly use it, because babel will convert the JSX into JS code - React.createelement() internally 
We cannot use if else inside the JSX code. 

JSX differences from HTML

Class – className
For – htmlFor
camelCase property naming convention
onclick – onClick
tabindex – tabIndex

JSX vs HTML
JSX 
-- No loops allowed 
-- No if else
-- No switch
Have to use loops but not explicitly -- map 
Dynamically rendered -- Rendered the jsx
In html
 <input type="button" value="Details" onclick="detailsEventHandler();" />
In JSX
synthetic events : wrapper around the normal html event
 <input type="button" value="Details" onClick={this.detailsEventHandler} />
detailsEventHandler -- has to written in the same component class outside the render function
