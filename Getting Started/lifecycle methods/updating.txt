Render

Do not change state or interact with DOM or make HTTP calls

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate( prevProps, prevState)

Capture some info from the DOM
Method will either return null or return a value. Returned value will be passed as the third parameter to the next method

componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
this is called after rerender in finished
