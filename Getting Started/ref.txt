What is ref in React?
A ref (short for reference) in React is used to get direct access to a DOM element or a component without triggering re-renders.

It’s like telling React:

“Hey, remember this element/component for me so I can interact with it directly later.”

🧠 When do you use ref?
To focus an input field

To trigger animations

To read values from an uncontrolled input

To measure DOM elements (like height, width, etc.)

To use third-party DOM libraries (like a datepicker or chart lib)

✍️ How to Create and Use a ref
✅ Using useRef (in functional components)

import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function TextInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null); // Create the ref

  const focusInput = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus(); // Access the DOM node and call focus
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" placeholder="Type here..." />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}
useRef(null) creates the ref.

ref={inputRef} attaches it to the input.

inputRef.current points to the actual DOM node.

You can also store mutable values with useRef that persist across renders without causing re-renders.


const count = useRef(0);
count.current += 1; // Doesn't trigger re-render like useState does
