React Fragment

A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <td>Hello</td>
        <td>World</td>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
We can also use <> </> empty tags like this, but we cannot pass key attribute but we can pass attribute with react fragment
