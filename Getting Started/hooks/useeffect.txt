useEffect hook
For Sideeffects in functional components
This is a replacement for the below lifecycle methods
componentDidMount()
componentDidUpdate()
componentWillUnmount()

useEffect hook will accept a function as a parameter which gets executed after every render of the component

import React from 'react'

export default function EffectHook() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() =>
    {document.title = `u clicked ${count} times`}
  )
  return (
    <div>
    <button onClick={() => setCount(prev => prev+1)}>Increment count {count}</button>
    </div>
  )
}

🧠 What This Code Does:
1. Initial Setup
count is initialized to 0 using useState.

A button is rendered that shows:
Increment count 0

2. Clicking the Button
Clicking the button increases the count (setCount(prev => prev + 1)).

The component re-renders with the new count.

3. useEffect Runs After Every Render
useEffect(() => { ... }) with no dependency array runs after every render.

It sets the document title of the browser tab like:

"u clicked 1 times"
"u clicked 2 times"
...
🎯 Result:
The button updates the count.

The browser tab title updates every time you click, showing how many times you clicked.



If we have more than one state, then this method works, if we only one state then it may throw error for that
Mimic only componentDidMount with useEffect by specifying a empty array [] as dependency

Mimic componentWillUnmount with useEffect by using a return statement
useEffect must not return anything besides a function, which is used for clean-up. 

Common Use Cases for Cleanup:
Use Case	What You Setup	What You Cleanup
🕰️ Timer	setInterval, setTimeout	clearInterval, clearTimeout
📞 API or sockets	Open WebSocket or fetch data	Close connection, cancel request
👂 Event listeners	window.addEventListener	removeEventListener
🧼 DOM manipulation	External DOM refs or libraries	Undo or destroy them

useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Tick');
  }, 1000);

  // Cleanup before component unmount or effect re-runs
  return () => {
    clearInterval(timer);
    console.log('Timer cleared');
  };
}, []);



And also 
  React.useEffect( () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        setCount((prev) => prev+1)
    }, 1000)},[]
  )

This code will not work properly as expected, In class component if we declare the setTimeout in the componentDidMount then it works as expected, but in useEffect if we are using the similar approach by passing empty array as dependency then the count will not increase every minute, we have to add count as the dependency here, 
  React.useEffect( () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        setCount((prev) => prev+1)
    }, 1000)},[count]
  )

And it is also a best practice to define the entire function inside the useEffect instead of just calling the function inside, as it will be easier to track the dependencies and mention the same in the dependency array
Advantage of useEffect to lifecycle methods :

With lifecycle methods, unrelated code are put together and related code are separated which was resolved by using hooks
We can define multipe useEffect hooks in a single component
