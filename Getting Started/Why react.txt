faster performance 
	--initial load of the app; time for the user reaction and response
	-- app size (file -- browser) plays a major role in initial load 
	-- cost involved
easier to develop
scalable
open source
less complexity, less processing
unit testing 
Facebook (meta),
preferred choice for app developers
largest community
component based architecture(modularity)
Reusability
virtual DOM
client side library
can be used for building mobile app(IOS,android)-- react native
Single Page App (SPA) -- one index.html file; based on the routing, load different contents in the same index.html – takes a little time for user request and response
uglification and minification -- app faster 
immutability -- once created, cannot be changed -- virtual DOM
MVC - model (data); view (UI); controller -- bridge b/w the model and view
Is not a framework; Only a library
js -- language; jquery -- library (write less do more)
Is only the view part of the application
uni directional flow of data – when model changes the view changes or vice versa 
unit testing 
	-- unit testing the front end completely
	-- unit test the module/component seperately
jest framework -- built in 
Angular -- two way data binding ;
any changes in the UI will get updated in the model automatically and vice versa
